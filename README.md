# Lung-CT-segmentation-for-COVID-19-detection
I used a deep learning model U-SegNet to perform semantic segmentation. The model detects Ground-Glass Opacities, Consolidation and Pleural Effusion. Ground-glass opacities have been shown to precede consolidations. Some reports have shown that ground-glass/consolidation measurements can enhance the prognosis estimation for Covid-19 patients.
Dataset taken from- http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/

Some example outputs from the model:
From left to right: ground-glass, consolidation, pleural effusion
